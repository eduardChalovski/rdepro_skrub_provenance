ExampleUse Case: Predicting Customer Return Likelihood

Goal:
Predict whether a customer will place another order in the next 6 months after their latest order. This is useful for targeted marketing, retention campaigns, and churn prevention.

Why it fits the TableVectorizer paradigm

Your datasets are heterogeneous, just like the employee salaries example:

Column type	Example from your data
Numeric	total_order_value, num_items, delivery_time_days
Datetime	order_purchase_timestamp, order_delivered_customer_date
Low-cardinality categorical	customer_state, payment_type
High-cardinality categorical	product_category_name, seller_id
Text-like identifiers	customer_id, product_id

TableVectorizer can automatically encode these into numerical features without manual work.
