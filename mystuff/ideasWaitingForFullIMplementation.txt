GDPR compliance -> go into dataframe, take provenance collumn, Itterate to find if a data point has been used in 
the final Dataframe.
If thats the case, go to the origin and remove the data point. After that, rerun pipeline

Data Leakeage -> have a set of data points that are FORBIDDEN (we cannot train on them). Split the data, but before
actually splitting the data, do some rpeprocessing on it (simulating leakeage)

fairness -> mark sensitive data and inject bias. use provanenace to detect how much bias in the end reulst of rpeprocessing
